# RGBW_LEDs

Welcome!  This is a C++ Library intended for controlling RGBW (or any four color LED chips/strips) using an Arduino.  The idea is to support many generalized and useful functions to streamline the process of controlling the strip.

To implement, simply place this directory in the 'libraries' sub-directory of your Arduino sketchbook directory and include 'RGBW_Strip.h' in your code.  Best of Luck and Enjoy!
